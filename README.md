Hearing Trade Project
The Hearing Trade project is where innovation meets sustainability. Our mission is to create a lasting impact in the lives of millions of individuals with hearing loss. Our open-source design breathes new life into discarded phones, transforming them into accessible hearing amplifiers.

Why We Do What We Do
Hearing loss affects 1 in 4 people in Saudi Arabia, and unfortunately, not all have the resources to access adequate treatment or devices. As the first digital enabler in the region, we at STC, have taken the initiative to serve our community.

The Hard Facts
In the year 2022 alone, a staggering 5.3 billion phones were discarded globally, creating a vast pool of electronic waste. Out of this, only 17% was recycled.

Our Innovative Approach
We devised a solution to combat both the challenges â€“ unavailability of affordable hearing aids and the escalating electronic waste. Our design repurposes microphones, speakers, chips, and batteries, components found in every phone model, significantly diminishing electronic waste.

The model goes further by using spare metal and plastic parts to construct electric conduits and 3D-printed cases, adding to the overall sustainability of the design.

How You Can Help
The technology is in your hands. With the Hearing Trade project, you can go further with it. By embracing this innovative design, you can play an active role in our journey towards a world with better hearing and less electronic waste. Together, we can create a sound difference.
